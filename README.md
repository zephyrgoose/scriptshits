# scriptshits
Random, unsorted scripts and programs I've made over the years that I don't want to permanently delete.

Generally, these scripts were written for a CTF, for some project, or some other reason. They will be for niche applications, and almost exclusively written in python3. They will vary in size, complexity, and efficiency.

I make no promises.
